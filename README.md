# Kahoot Bot 🤖

#### Simple Kahoot Bot that randomly reply to a kahoot game ✨

## Purpose:

To not play this **shitty game** in class anymore ╰（‵□′）╯

## Made With:

1. `Elegance` ✨😎
2. `Typescript` (Becasue I'm not a _terrorist_ 😅)
3. `Fastify` ⚡ (Because Golang is not enough mature for web-scrapping ＞﹏＜)
4. `Puppeteer` (For page crawling, basic ^\_^)
5. `Socket.io` 🌐 (I didn't want to add a timeout of 30min to my requests so... =￣ ω ￣=)
6. `Svelte` for the frontend (because I have **dignity** 😘) (_TODO:_ rewrite frontend in `yew.rs` つ ≧▽≦ つ)
